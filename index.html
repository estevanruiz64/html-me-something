                        <p>I've been to Vista only a handful of times, but every time has become a truly cherished memory. There are a lot of ramen shops popping up in STL trying to capitalize on the soup's sudden local popularity, but nowhere comes close to Vista. I used to feel pretty unimpressed with the $15 bowls of Japanese soup, much preferring Vietnamese pho for my noodle soup fix. But Vista's Chef Chris Bork has thoroughly changed that, and I couldn't be happier.</p>

                        <p>If the music doesn't pull you in, the food will. Hands down some of the best sandwiches in STL and with a menu packing over 30 of them anyone is sure to find something that will tickle their fancy. This writer's personal favorites are the Italian beef and the Blues City Dog. Nowhere outside of Chi-Town itself can you find these dishes served up better. Did I mention the live music? Well, there's always music and it's often live -- and most important, it's always good.</p>

                        <p>You would be forgiven for passing by this place, as the exterior is that of a dilapidated cardboard box. However, the authentic Szechuan grub you can get here (off the secret menu, that is) is so fiery and delicious that it is our duty as foodies to look past this sad outward appearance and venture forth to true ancient Szechuan enlightenment. Get the Chongqing chicken, a spicy wok-fried chicken dish riddled with pink Sezchuan peppercorns that will make your entire mouth numb with their subtle flowery flavor. Then buy me some, because you owe me for the tip.</p>

                        <p>Imagine this: It's a Sunday morning in June and you had a few too many frosty Budweisers last night at your buddy's summer BBQ. As the alarm that you set so you wouldn't sleep all day goes off, all you know is you need some good diner grub to soak up the war going on in your stomach right now. Enter Southwest Diner, the ultimate in STL diner experiences with plenty of delicious Tex-Mex to boot. Not to mention one of the best Bloody Marys around. Oh, and two words: cornmeal pancakes.</p>

                        <p>Alright, I'm about to let you in on one of the best kept secrets in the bi-state area. You've probably heard all about the STL fried chicken scene: Southern, Byrd &amp; Barrel, Porters, etc. Well, here's the truth: Eckert's Country Restaurant is housing the BEST fried chicken around. Don't believe me? Go check for yourself. Worst case scenario you spend some time in the outdoors picking delicious, fresh fruit and perusing the incredible country store that's full of locally made goodies. And sure, it's Belleville, IL and not STL. Sue me.</p>
